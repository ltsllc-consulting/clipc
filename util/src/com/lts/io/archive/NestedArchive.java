 * An archive that can contain other archives.
 * 
 * <P/>
 * A nested archive operates the same way that a regular archive does
 * except that the entry strings can specify multiple levels of archives.
 * Archives are separated with "!" characters.  For example:
 * 
 * <P/>
 * foo/bar/nerts.zip!what/ever/spam.jar!a/b/c.doc
 * 
 * <P/>
 * Specifies the file c.doc, which lives in the archive "spam.jar"  spam.jar, 
 * in turn, lives in the nerts.zip archive under the entry 
 * "what/ever/spam.jar"  nerts.zip, in turn, lives in the "top level" archive
 * that an instance of this class represents.
 *
 * <P/>
 * This interface is similar to the java.io.Serializeable interface in that 
 * it does not define any new methods (i.e. it is a "merit badge" interface).
