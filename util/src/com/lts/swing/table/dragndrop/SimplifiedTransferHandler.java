/**
 * A simplified approach to Drag and Drop support.
 * <P>
 * This class presents a simple approach to implementing Drag and Drop in Java. In order
 * to do this, it makes the following assumptions:
 * 
 * <UL>
 * <LI>All transfers are within the same Java VM.</LI>
 * <LI>All transfers use raw objects, no text, etc.</LI>
 * </UL>
 * 
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * If you need to implement Drag and Drop that, for example, can use a number of "data
 * flavors" such as text, files, objects, etc. then you are better off subclassing
 * {@link TransferHandler} rather than this class.
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * Subclasses will need to "know" what sort of data is being sent to them, which can mean
 * that all transfers are limited to the same JComponent.
 * </P>
 * 
 * <H3>Drag vs. Cut/Copy/Paste</H3>
 * Cut, copy and paste all use the clipboard as either the destination or the source for
 * their data. Drag is different in that it never uses the clipboard --- all data is kept
 * in memory during the transfer.
 * 
 * <H3>Class of Data</H3>
 * This interface does not specify the class of the data being copied or pasted.
 * The implementing class is responsible for ensuring that the proper types of 
 * data are being passed around.  This means that an instance of this transfer 
 * handler must know how to import data from <I>any</I> source that uses this 
 * class.
 * 
 * <P>
 * If your system is more complex than this, then it would be advisable to either
 * package the data in some sort of "envelope" class that all implementers know 
 * about, or use the TransferHandler mechanism directly.
 * </P>
