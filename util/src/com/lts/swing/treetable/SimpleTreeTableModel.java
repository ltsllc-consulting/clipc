/**
 * A DefaultTreeModel that can display column data for the various nodes in 
 * the tree.
 * 
 * <P/>
 * This is an abstract class.  To be instantiable, the following methods must
 * be defined in a subclass:
 * <UL>
 * <LI/>getColumnCount
 * <LI/>getColumnName
 * <LI/>getValueAt
 * <LI/>isCellEditable
 * <LI/>setValueAt
 * </UL>
 * 
 * <P/>
 * This approach assumes that, for a particular tree node, the object can 
 * display column information about that node.  For example, if you have a 
 * tree that shows departments in a company, with leaf nodes being the 
 * employees, then the model might know that the first column is always 
 * the last name of the employee, the next column is the first name, etc.
 * 
 * <P/>
 * The class assumes that the class for all columns is string.  If other types
 * are desired, then the getColumnClass method should be overridden.
