/**
 * An object that watches for changes in the window that a Container lives in and

 * <P>
 * On creation, an instance of this class is notified when ContainerListener events
 * occur.  When the monitored Container's Container is changed, the instance will 
 * trace up the hierarchy until it finds the root Container.  If the Container is 
 * capable of having a title, then the instance will set the title of the root to
 * the title it is set to in this class.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The container to be monitored cannot be changed once the object is created.  If
 * a null value is used in the constructor, this class will do nothing.  
 * 
 * <P>
 * The instance watches for changes in the container of the monitored container.  
 * Directly or indirectly, this is the window where the monitored container lives.
 * When the monitored container is put into a window or some other containing 
 * object, this instance will be notified, and it will, in turn, set the title of 
 * the containing window.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The title can be changed by calling {@link #changeTitle(String)}.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Only certain "windows" can have their titles set.  In particular, applets 
 * {@link JApplet} and subclasses of {@link JWindow} do not have titles.  So long 
 * as one of those classes is used to contain the monitored Container, this class
 * will not do anything.
