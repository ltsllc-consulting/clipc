/**
 * Data that is shared by all the frames/dialogs in the wizard.
 * 
 * <H3>Abstract Class</H3>
 * To create an instantiatable class, a number of methods need to be defined.
 * All of the methods share the same basic behavior: return the WizardPanel 
 * associated with the next/previous/whatever window, given the current window.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Returning null from any of these methods indicates that no window should be
 * displayed.  The getCancelPanel, for example, usually returns null; since the 
 * user wants to quite the whole process when they click cancel.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The methods that should be defined are:
 * 
 * <UL>
 * <LI>getPreviousPanel
 * <LI>getNextPanel
 * <LI>getFinishPanel
 * <LI>getCancelPanel
 * </UL>
 * 
 * <H3>Description</H3>
 * This class helps implement "wizard" style functionality.  With a "wizard" 
 * type approach, the user is presented with a sequence of screens that gather 
 * information that the system uses to perform some operation.  Throughout the 
 * process the user can move forward or backwards through the sequence by using
 * the "next" or "previous" buttons.  This implies that something is keeping 
 * the information entered so far to facilitate such movement.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Keeping track of the information entered so far is where this class comes in.
 * Developers should subclass this class to contain the information gathered at 
 * each stage.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Another function of this class is to determine what the next/previous step 
 * in the process is.  Such decisions are encapsulated by the 
 * get&lt;action&gt;Panel methods.  When the user hits the next button, for example
 * the getNextPanel method is called to determine what should be displayed next.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class is very tightly coupled with the WizardPanel class.  While it is
 * possible to use it with some other class, it would be difficult to adapt it 
 * to such a use.
