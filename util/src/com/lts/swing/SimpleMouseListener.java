/**
 * A MouseAdapter that can display a popup menu and respond to double-click 
 * actions.
 *
 * <H2>Abstract Class</H2>
 * To be instantiateable, subclasses must implement the following methods:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>{@link #showPopup(Component, int, int)}
 * <LI>{@link #doubleClick(MouseEvent)}
 * </UL>
 * 
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * This class simplifies dealing with the mouse in circumstances that I typically
 * encounter.  The two most common reasons I use a mouse listener are to 1) show
 * a popup menu and 2) respond to a double-click event.  The class filters mouse
 * events down to these two events for classes to implement.
