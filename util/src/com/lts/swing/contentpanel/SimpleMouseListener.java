/**
 * A simplified mouse listener interface to be used with CPMouseListener.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Three common uses for mouse listeners are to listen for single click events,
 * listen for double click events and to display popup menus.  Using this 
 * interface, clients can quickly and easily implement these functions.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Here is an example implementation for a class that just wants to watch for
 * double click events:
 * <PRE>
 * public SimpleMouseListener mySimpleMouseListener() {
 *     public void singleClick (Object source) {}
 *     public void doubleClick (Object source) { doDoubleClick(source); }
 *     public JPopupMenu getPopup (Component component) { return null; }
 * };
 * </PRE>
 * 
 * <P>
 * Here is an example for a class that wants to provide popups:
 * <PRE>
 * protected Map myComponentToPopup;
 * public SimpleMouseListener mySimpleMouseListener() {
 *     public void singleClick (Object source) {}
 *     public void doubleClick (Object source) { doDoubleClick(source); }
 *     public JPopupMenu getPopup (Component component) {
 *         return (JPopupMenu) myComponentToPopup.get(component);
 *     }
 * };
 * </PRE>
 * 
 *
