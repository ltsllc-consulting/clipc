/**
 * Display a Component in another thread, then perform an activity.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class creates a new thread that displays a component, waits for it to 
 * close, and then calls the {@link #afterDisplay()} method.  By default, the 
 * afterDisplay method does nothing, so those clients that just want to show 
 * a component in another thread can use this class as is.  
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * Clients that want to do something after displaying the Component can define
 * a new version of this class, often with an anonymous inner method, that 
 * performs some action.
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * Suppose you want to display a window to edit some information.  The user can
 * close the window by clicking on an OK or Cancel button.  Based on how the 
 * window closes, you want to either accept or discard the edits.
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * Here is one way to implement that scenario with this class:
 * </P>
 * 
 * <CODE>
 * <PRE>
 * JFrame myFrame;
 * 
 * void foo()
 * {
 *     myFrame = createAndInitializeFrameMehtod();
 *     BlockThread thread = new BlockThread() {
 *         protected void afterDisplay() {
 *             processResults();
 *         }
 *     }
 *     
 *     thread.display();
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * void processResults()
 * {
 *     &lt;do something useful with the results of the edit&gt;;
 * }
 * </PRE>
 * </CODE>
 * 
 * <P>
 * NOTE THAT display() RETURNS IMMEDIATELY!!  It does not mean that the window 
 * has closed!  Use the afterDisplay method for that.
 * </P>
 *
