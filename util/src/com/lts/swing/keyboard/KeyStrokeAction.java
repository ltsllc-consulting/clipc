/**
 * An AbstractAction that is specific to keyboard events.
 * 
 * <H2>Abstract Class</H2>
 * Subclasses must define:
 * 
 * <UL>
 * <LI>{@link #keyAction(InputKey)</LI>
 * </UL>
 * 
 * <H2>Note</H2>
 * The class uses the {@link ExceptionHandler} class to process any exceptions
 * that occur while processing key strokes.  To use a different approach, subclass
 * AbstractAction instead of this class. 
 * 
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * This class works by "remembering" the {@link InputKey} that the handler is defined
 * to process.  The problem with {@link AbstractAction} is that a) it is not apparent
 * whether that class "remembers" the key event that triggered the action and b) 
 * if it does, it is not apparent where it is remembered.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class solves the problem by requiring an InputKey to be provided when the 
 * instance is defined and then providing this info in the {@link #keyAction(InputKey)}
 * call.
 * </P>
