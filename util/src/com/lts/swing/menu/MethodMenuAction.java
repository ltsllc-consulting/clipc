/**
 * Call a method in response to a menu item being selected.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class is actually applicable to all objects that accept listeners who
 * implement {@link ActionListener}, though it was developed for menus.
 *
 * <P>
 * Subclasses must implement {@link #processException(Exception)} in order to be 
 * instantiateable.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class invokes a method on a particular instance when {@link #actionPerformed(ActionEvent)}
 * is called.  The method invocation is wrapped in a try...catch block that catches
 * java.lang.Exception and all its subclasses --- thus all checked and unchecked exceptions.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The underlying method is expected to require no arguments, though it may be 
 * a class or instance method.  To use a static (class) method, pass null as  the 
 * receiver to the classes constructor.
