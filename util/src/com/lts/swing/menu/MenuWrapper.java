/**
 * Provide a uniform interface for various menu-like classes.
 * 
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * This class allows menu builders to treat JMenu, JPopupMenu and JMenuBar in 
 * the same manner.  The primary thing that such builders need to do is add separators
 * and menu items to menus.  Instead of having three separate versions of essentially
 * the same method for each menu-like class, builders can program to this interface
 * and then have three methods that wrap an instance of this class.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The primary issue with menu-like classes is that JMenuBar does not support menu
 * separators whereas JMenu and JPopupMenu do.  If an attempt is made to add a 
 * separator to a JMenuBar, the addSeparator method will throw an exception.
