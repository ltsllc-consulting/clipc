/**
 * This record represents that two objects have already been compared against
 * each other or that the system is in the process of comparing them.
 * 
 * <P/>
 * This is useful in ensuring that the comparrision system does not go into an
 * infinite loop. Consider this rather contrivied example:
 * 
 * <PRE>
 * 
 * public class Foo { public Object whatever; }
 * 
 * ...
 * 
 * Foo f1 = new Foo(); Foo f2 = new Foo(); f1.whatever = f2; f2.whatever = f1;
 * 
 * </PRE>
 * 
 * 
 * If we were to do a field-by-field equivalance comparrison (ffec), we would
 * start with field whatever of f1, decide that it is a non-primitive object,
 * and recursively try to perform an ffec on it.  Upon examining the fields 
 * of f1, we discover that it is also an complex object and do an ffec on it
 * as well.  The process continues infinitely.
 * 
 * <P/>
 * Simply remembering which objects we have already traversed may not be good
 * enough because a given instance may be compared against multiple other 
 * instances of other classes during the course of the compare.  Just because
 * it was equivalent to another field of one other object does not mean that 
 * it is equivalent to all other fields it might be compared against.
 *
