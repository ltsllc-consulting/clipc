/**
 * A class that implements a shared queue --- an object that allows communications
 * between multiple threads in a first in, first out fashion.
 *
 * <P/>
 * One of the aspects of a shared queue is that, if there is nothing on the queue,
 * then asking for the next item from the queue will cause the requesting thread
 * to block until something is available.
 *
 * <P/>
 * This implementation places simplicity above efficiency.  that its, it does 
 * things like putting a potential waiter on the queue of waiters even if the 
 * wait queue is empty and there is an item available.  If you find that this 
 * class becomes a bottle-neck, then it would probably help to rewrite some of the 
 * routines so that they are a bit more intelligent about how they handle the 
 * synchronization issues.
 *
 * <P/>
 * For people who might not know exactly how Thread.interrupt (like the author
 * of this code :-), it is safe to call Thread.interrupt on a thread that is 
 * running inside of the next method.  This is because Thread.interrupt merely
 * sets some sort of flag, it does not actually cause an asychronous transfer
 * of control as some people might expect a method called "interrupt" to cause.
