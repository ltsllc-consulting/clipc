 * </A>
 * Three of the methods required by this interface have fairly standard blocks 
 * of code.  It cannot be directly supplied because this is an interface, rather
 * than a superclass, but you can implement them by simply copying the following
 * code:
 * 
 * <P>
 * <CODE>
 * <PRE>
 * public DeepCopier continueDeepCopy(Map map, boolean copyTransients) throws DeepCopyException
 * {
 *     return (DeepCopier) DeepCopyUtil.continueDeepCopy(this, map, copyTransients);
 * }
 *
 * public Object deepCopy() throws DeepCopyException
 * {
 *     return DeepCopyUtil.deepCopy(this, false);
 * }
 *
 * public Object deepCopy(boolean copyTransients) throws DeepCopyException
 * {
 *     return DeepCopyUtil.deepCopy(this, copyTransients);
 * }
 * </PRE>
 * </CODE>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <A anchor="#continueDeepCopy.implementation">
 * <H4>Implement continueDeepCopy</H4>
 * </A>
 * This method will look something like this:
 * <P>
 * <CODE>
 * <PRE>
 * public void deepCopyData(Object ocopy, Map map, boolean copyTransients) throws DeepCopyException
 * {
 *     &lt;containing class name&gt; copy = (&lt;containing class name&gt;) ocopy;
 * 
 *     copy.&lt;data member 1&gt; = &lt;copy data member 1&gt;;
 *     copy.&lt;data member 2&gt; = &lt;copy data member 2&gt;;
 *     copy.&lt;data member 3&gt; = &lt;copy data member 3&gt;;
 *     ...
 *     copy.&lt;data member n&gt; = &lt;copy data member n&gt;;
 *
 *     super.deepCopyData(ocopy, map, copyTransients);
 * }
 * </PRE>
 * </CODE>
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * A deep copy of an object is completely independent of the original.  Changes 
 * to any data member have no effect on the original.
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * Care must be taken when making a deep copy because you can end up copying 
 * the entire java VM's worth of data, especially when deailing with classes 
 * that have listeners.
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * For this reason, when making a deep copy, the method has a flag for whether 
 * or not transient data memembers, like lists of listener objects, should be copied
 * along with the non-transients.  It is almost always a good idea to set this 
 * flag to false so that transients are <I>not</I> copied.
 * </P>
