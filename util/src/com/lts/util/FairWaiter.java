/**
 * Implement a first-in, first-out waiting scheme.
 *
 * <P/>
 * This class was created because the Java wait/notify is not guaranteed to be
 * "fair," let alone FIFO.  That is, in the general case, it is possible for 
 * a thread to wait forever, even when enough notifies have occurred for the 
 * waiter to be awakened if things where FIFO.
 *
 * <P/>
 * Care must be taken when using this class because of the nature of the wait
 * and notify methods.  Specifically, the various wait and notify methods are 
 * all public final, so it is possible for a client to bypass the whole
 * fairness algorithm by using wait instead of fairWait.  Similarly, the 
 * scheme will not work if the client uses notify instead of notifyAll.
 * This being the case, it is a good idea to use another class to handle access
 * to this class, thereby protecting the methods that clients should not use.
 *
 * <P/>
 * For this scheme to work, a client must use notifyAll instead of notify.  
 * This is inefficient, since all but one of the waiting threads will end up 
 * going back to sleep, but necessary because of Java's wait/notify scheme.
