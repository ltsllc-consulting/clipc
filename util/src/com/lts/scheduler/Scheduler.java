/**
 * A service that allows clients to schedule notifications.
 * 
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * Using this class, clients can schedule to be notified after after some point in time.
 * Clients call {@link #getInstance()} and then {@link #notifyAt(ScheduledEventListener, long)}
 * to arrange for notification.  At or after the specified point in time, 
 * {@link ScheduledEventListener#scheduledEvent(SchedulerEvent)} is called.
 * 
 * <H3>Threading Issues</H3>
 * Clients must not block the thread in which {@link ScheduledEventListener#scheduledEvent(SchedulerEvent)}
 * is called.  If that is done, all event delivery will be stopped for all clients.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class is intended to run in its own thread.  When {@link #getInstance()} is
 * called, a new thread will be created for the scheduler if one does not already exist.
 *

	 * not exist, the method returns without doing anything further.  If a thread
