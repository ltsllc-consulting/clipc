 * An object with an integer priority value that can change at any time.

 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * The literal meaning of this interface is that the implementor returns a 
 * value for getPriority, and the value can change between calls.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The implied meaning of this interface is that there are some number of 
 * objects, one of which is the "highest priority," another of which is the 
 * "next highest" and so on.  The collection may be sorted by priority, but that
 * order is not stable.  The relative priority of the elements can change at 
 * any time.
