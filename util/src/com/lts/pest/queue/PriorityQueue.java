/**
 * A dynamic, synchronized collection of elements whose order is based on 
 * priority.
 * 
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * Instances of this class are ordered collections of elements whose order can 
 * change instant by instant.  The order at anyone one time is called a snapshot
 * and is obtained by simply iterating over the entire collection and calling 
 * "getPriority" on each element and then sorting the collection based on these
 * values.
 * 
 * <P>
 * If two elements have the same priority in a snapshot, the order of the two 
 * elements relative to each other is not defined --- either ordering is valid.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The class does not allow nulls or duplicates.  Attempting to add a null value
 * results in a NullPointerException.  Attempting to add the same element twice
 * results in the element being added once --- subsequent attempts to add the 
 * element have no effect.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Presence or absence from the queue is based on identify.

	 * Instances of this class are used to maintain a stable priority value of
	 * elements in the priority queue while creating a snapshot.  The priority 
	 * of any one element may change from one call to getPriority to the next,
	 * but stable values are required if one is going to sort the list.  This 
	 * class solves the problem by "remembering" the priority of an element at 
	 * the time instance of this class is created.  That priority is then used 
	 * for sorting the contained element, thus creating a stable value.
