/**
 * The part of the system that is responsible for gathering data from the user.
 * 
 * <H3>Deadlock Warning</H3>
 * Some of the methods in this class either directly or indireclty obtain a lock
 * on the "current instance of GatherMetaData."  Such methods are not marked as 
 * synchronized, and the method descriptions much be read to determine which ones
 * do so.
 * 
 * <H3>Abstract Class</H3>
 * The following methods must be defines in order to create a class that can be 
 * instantiated:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>gatherData
 * <LI>getGatherData
 * </UL>
 * 
 * <H3>Description</H3>
 * Clients use this object to
 * 
 * <P>
 * <UL>
 * <LI>set the gather frequency
 * <LI>start gathering data
 * <LI>stop gathering data
 * <LI>When the next gather will take place
 * </UL>
 * 
 * <P>
 * <H3>Gather Period</H3>
 * This is the number of milliseconds that the application should wait between prompts
 * to the user.  This is also the amount of time that a sample represents: if the period
 * is 12 minutes when sampling takes place, then the duration for that sample will be 
 * 12 minutes as well. 
 * 
 * <P>
 * Note that gather frequency is usually a factor of 60.  The prime factors of 60 are 
 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 5.
 * 
 * <P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * Alignment happens automatically, unless the period requested is not a factor of 60.
 * That is, if the period is not factorable by 2,3 or 5.  For example, if the period
 * is 7. 
 * 
 * <H3>Endless Loops</H3>
 * This class has the potential for getting into an endless loop because the method 
 * {@link #updateGatherData(Long)} calls {@link GatherMetaData#setNextSample(Long)}, 
 * and that method calls {@link GatherMetaData#fireDataChanged()}, which calls 
 * updateGatherData.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The solution for this vulnerability is to ensure the following:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>One and only one instance of this class can exist.
 * <LI>Each instance of this class is forced to ignore any calls to GatherMetaData if 
 * it is already in the process of making one.
 * </UL>
 * 
 * <P>
 * The class ensures that only one instance exists via the following:
 * 
 * <P>
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Only methods in this class can access the constructor.
 * <LI>The only method that uses the constructor is {@link #createSingleton()}.
 * <LI>createSingleton only calls the constructor once/VM in the vast majority of
 * cases.
 * </UL>
 *
 * <P>
 * The class ensures that it can make only one call to GatherMetaData via the following:
 * 
 * <P>
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Only one method directly writes to GatherMetaData, updateGatherData.
 * <LI>updateGatherData is private --- only other methods in this class can use it.
 * <LI>updateGatherData is static synchronized --- only one thread per VM.
 * <LI>updateGatherData ignores the call unless {@link #previousGatherTime} is null.
 * <LI>updateGatherData sets previousGatherTime to null before writing to GatherMetaData.   
 * </UL>
 *
 * <P>
 * In the absolute case, access modifiers can be ignored, multiple instances of the
 * same class can be created in the same VM, etc.  These measures should alert 
 * developers of the potential hazards of doing so.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This being the case, only this class can create an instance of this class --- it
 * has a private constructor.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The only method that uses the constructor is {@link #getInstance()}.
