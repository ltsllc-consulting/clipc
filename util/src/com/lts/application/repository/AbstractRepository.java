/**
 * A class that simplifies creating an ApplicationRepository.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Subclasses need only implement the load and store methods while this class
 * handles all the other details associated with an application repository.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The load method should cause the repository to represent the same data that
 * is currently on the disk.  In the case of a temporary repository or one 
 * that has never been saved, this is the same as creating a new repository 
 * instance.
 * 
 * <P>
 * When load is called, the subclass should reconstitute the application 
 * specific data from the underlying repository file.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The store method should cause the underlying file that contains the 
 * repository data to be the same as the data currently in the object --- 
 * basically save the data.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Whe store is called, the subclass should serialize the the application 
 * data to the underlying repository file.
