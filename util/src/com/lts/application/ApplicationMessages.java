/**
 * Defines a basic set of application errors that can occur.
 * 
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * This class is intended to be used with the Application.getMessage methods 
 * to look up and format various informational and error messages.  The constants
 * defined here should be used as the key for lookup from a resource bundle.  The 
 * result should be used as the format string to create the message.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The key values have the following format:
 * <CODE>
 * <PRE>
 *     public static final String &lt;constant name&gt; = 
 *         &lt;class name&gt;.&lt;type&gt;.&lt;message name&gt;;
 * </PRE>
 * </CODE>
 * 
 * <P>
 * For example:
 * <CODE>
 * <PRE>
 *     public static final String ERROR_LOOKUP_FAILED = 
 *         "com.lts.application.error.lookupFailed";
 * </PRE>
 * </CODE>
 * 
 * <H3>Class Name</H3>
 * A fully-qualified class name is used as the prefix for the value so that clients
 * can more easily avoid key conflicts.
 * 
 * <H3>Message Type</H3>
 * <P>
 * The application framework defines the following message types:
 * <UL>
 * 	<LI>prompt
 * 	<LI>info
 * 	<LI>warning
 * 	<LI>error
 * 	<LI>fatal
 * 	<LI>critical
 * </UL>
 * 
 * <P>
 * A prompt is a message to displaly to the user when asking for input. For
 * example: "How old are you?".
 * 
 * <P>
 * Info messages are used when displaying information to the user. For example:
 * "The current time is {0}".
 * 
 * <P>
 * A warning is some sort of minor error message.  For example: "You really need
 * to lose some weight".
 * 
 * <P>
 * An error message indicates that something happend that prevents the application
 * from fulfilling a request from the user.  For example: "The file, {0}, is
 * corrupted."
 * 
 * <P>
 * A fatal error indicates a situation so severe that the application is going to
 * terminate in response to it.  For example: "Could not create temp file area,
 * application will terminate." 
 * 
 * <P>
 * The critical message type indicates a situation where the application must
 * terminate and message lookup/formatting will be unavailable while doing so.
 * Generally speaking, these sorts of errors do not have constants, since there by
 * definition the system cannot look up the message to use to format them.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Rather than defining a critical constant, throw an instance of
 * CriticalApplicationException.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Not being able to load the resource bundles, which contain the key/format
 * string pairs, is an example of a critical error.
 * 
 * 
 * <H3>Name</H3>
