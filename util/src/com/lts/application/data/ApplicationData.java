/**
 * An object that handles the serialization of the application's data.
 * 
 * <H2>Note</H2>
 * In addition to defining the methods outlined in this interface, classes are
 * also expected to define a public, no-argument constructor.  Java serialization
 * explicitly states that the constructor for a class is <I>not</I> called during
 * deserialization.  Unfortunately, Java does not provide any way to allocate a 
 * new instance without calling a constructor of some sort,  
 * <P>
 * Instances of this class implement the following:
 * </P>
 * 
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Track whether or not the data has been changed (dirty/clean).</LI>
 * <LI>Implement loading & storing the data to a repository.</LI>
 * <LI>Implement any additional logic required for post deserialization.</LI>
 * </UL>
 *
 * <P>
 * Post deserialization is the notion that the state of the application data 
 * may not be completely consistent after being deserialized.  One reason is that 
 * the class constructor is specifically not called during deserialization, so 
 * any initialization code will not be invoked.  Especially if the application 
 * data has added or removed fields since the last serialization, it is possible 
 * for fields to be inconsistent after an instance is deserialized.
 * </P>
