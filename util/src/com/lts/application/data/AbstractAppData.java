/**
 * A generic interface for application data.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class simplifies processing application data by providing a view of the 
 * data as a list of {@link ApplicationDataElement} objects.  The usual clean/dirty
 * status is kept by the class as well as passing along event messages like 
 * {@link #postDeserialize()}.
 * </P>
 * 
 * <P>
 * Concrete subclasses must implement the {@link #getDataElements()} method and 
 * the {@link #processDataElement(ApplicationDataElement)} method.  getDataElements
 * assembles a list of the applications data, broken into ApplicationDataElements.
 * processDataElement is used to receive data (such as during deserialization) 
 * and put it in the right place for the application.
