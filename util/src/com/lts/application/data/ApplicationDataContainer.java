/**
 * An object that contains ApplicationData objects.
 * 
 * <P>
 * An object of this interface does not have data of its own, instead it contains 
 * instances of {@link com.lts.application.data.ApplicationData} that actually
 * contain the data.  An instance of this object returns true when {@link #isDirty()}
 * is called if any of its constituents returns true for 
 * {@link ApplicationData#isDirty()} and false if none of those methods return true.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Calling {@link #setDirty(boolean)} on this method results in that call being
 * passed along to each constituent object.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The reconstitutionComplete method is intended to be called after an instance of 
 * this class has been deserialized --- when an instance has been restored to memory
 * from its serialized state.  In practical terms, it allows the containing object 
 * to commence monitoring of its constituent objects.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The element property accessors provide basic access to consituent objects rather
 * than bulk methods.
