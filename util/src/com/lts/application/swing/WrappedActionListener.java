/**
 * An AbstractAction that handles exceptions.
 * <H2>Abstract Class</H2>
 * Subclasses must define the following methods to be instantiateable:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>{@link #basicAction(ActionEvent)}
 * </UL>
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * This class handles the situation where a implementer of {@link ActionListener} throws
 * an exception in the {ActionListener{@link #actionPerformed(ActionEvent)}} method by
 * calling {@link Application#showException(Throwable)} when such an event occurs.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Subclasses must implement {@link #basicAction(ActionEvent)} rather than 
 * actionPerformed, and basicAction can throw any subclass of {@link Exception}
 * that it wants to.
 * 
 * <P>
 * The basic problem that this class solves is to allow applications to define their
 * exception handling policy for ActionEvents in a single place, rather than having to
 * to place references to this class in all their UI code.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class defines the actionPerformed method to call basicAction; and this call is
 * wrapped in a try...catch block. The catch watches for java.lang.Exception and calls
 * {@link Application#showException(Throwable)} if it encounters one.
