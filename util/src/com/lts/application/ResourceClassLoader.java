/**
 * A ClassLoader that uses an alternative approach to loading resources.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class basically only cares about the {@link java.lang.ClassLoader#getResource(java.lang.String)}
 * method --- all other methods use the superclass version.
 * 
 * <P>
 * This class tries using the superclass version of 
 * {@link java.lang.ClassLoader#getResource(java.lang.String)} to get resources,
 * but, if that fails, it tries using the class loader that loaded this class to 
 * load the resource.  This is useful in situations where certain system classes
 * return null for {@link java.lang.Class#getClassLoader()}.  
 * 
 * <P>
 * In some situations, system classes will report that they have a null class 
 * loader.  This could be because they are loaded in a debugging environment,
 * but it is difficult to ascertain the exact reason for this.
