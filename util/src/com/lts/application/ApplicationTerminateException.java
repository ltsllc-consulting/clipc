 * An exception that signals the applications desire to terminate the program.

 * <H3>Description</H3>
 * This exception is thrown when the application cannot continue executing for some
 * reason.  It is not a subclass of ApplicationException because there is no message
 * to be displayed to the user --- if this exception is thrown, then the thrower 
 * should have already give the user an error message explaining the situation.
 * 
 * <P>
 * Under most circumstances, anyone catching this should either re-throw it or call
 * System.exit immediately.
